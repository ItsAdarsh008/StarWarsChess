# StarWarsChess
Chess made from scratch using Java Applets (very old), with a star wars theme.

My computer science teacher used to always tell us that 'we don't know how easy we have it with all our new IDE's and new tools'.  

Using JDK 7, paper, and sheer will, I will be creating Chess from a single IO library I found from my computer science teacher's website. Then, I'll add a star wars theme and sound effects. Why not?
